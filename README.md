#Title: Could location and time predict the likelihood of a specific crime being committed?
#Overview: Our focus for this research is encompassed by the idea, does location and time predict the likelihood of a specific crime being committed? The reason we are focusing on specific crimes being committed at locations and times is due to the fact that we can understand better ways of setting up security systems,  better tracking of crimes of specific neighborhoods or ZIP Codes.
